# EdgeAI-ModelUtils

This repository will host pip installable utilities for EdgeAI / Deep Neural Network Inference.  

This is not meant to be directly used by users, but instead to be included as part of Python requirement files in other repositories such as edgeai-benchmark and edgeai-tidl-tools.

Currently, this contains components that were previously included as part of edgeai-benchmark (https://github.com/TexasInstruments/edgeai-benchmark, https://bitbucket.itg.ti.com/projects/EDGEAI-ALGO/repos/edgeai-benchmark/browse).
